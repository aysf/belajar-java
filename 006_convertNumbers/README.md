# Converting Numeric Values

## How to run

1. Compile `javac com\example\java\Main.java`
2. Run `java com.example.java.Main`

## Note

- Widening the type: when we convert from the type that use small amount of memory to the type that use large amount of memory
- Narrowing the type: opposite term from above
- when you assign one primitive value to another, you're making a copy, not a reference
- when you narrowing value to another, you must use casting syntax
